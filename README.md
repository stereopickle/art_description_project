# art_description_project  
#### Updated July 13  
  
In this project, I explore Harvard Museum art description data to investigate what we can learn about art and the pattern of art consumption, trend throughout the history using the descriptive language and language categorizations. 
Currently, it is at the beginning stage, and I will update as I add more analyses.  

## Data Collection and Preprocessing  
001.Data_Preprocessing.ipynb includes steps I took to pull data from Harvard Museum API, and to preprocess description data.  
Preprocessing included removing non-alphabetic strings, making all lower case, removing stop words using NLTK stop words corpus, testing different stemming and lemmatization and applying them.  

## Exploratory Data 1 (Word Frequency)
010.EDA_1.ipynb includes process of dividing preprocessed data into different bins (currently only periods and culture) and plotting word frequency bar plots and word clouds.  
In the results section, I discuss the finding  more in detail.
